fields to choose from. They vary from fields which are traditionally "electrical" like
communications/signal processing, Analog & RF, Power Systems, Embedded Systems, Photonics
to fields like Control & Optimisation, theoretical physics, neuroscience, Biomedical Engineering
& Instrumentation, Applied Mathematics, mechatronics, machine learning & Computer Vision.
Basically our students can diversify into any other field of their interest.
Our students regularly get MS/PhD admits from top US universities like Stanford, UCB, Harvard,
